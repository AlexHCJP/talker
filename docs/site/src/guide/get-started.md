# Getting Started

## Instalation

For [Dart](https://dart.dev/) applications you need add **talker** dependency to your **pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
dependencies:
  talker: ^1.0.0
```

For [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) applications you can add **talker_flutter** or **talker** dependency to your **pubspec.yaml**
```yaml
dependencies:
  talker_flutter: ^1.1.0
```

**What's difference ?**<br>
**talker_flutter** has advanced features that's convenient to use in the Flutter application
like [TalkerScreen](../guide/talker-flutter.html#TalkerScreen) or [TalkerRouteObserver](../guide/talker-flutter.html#TalkerRouteObserver)<br>
**talker** package working both for dart and flutter applications
 
## Easy to use
All you need for the first start is to import the dependency and create an instance of the Talker class
```dart
import 'package:talker/talker.dart';
void main(){
  final talker = Talker();
  talker.info('I`m alive ðŸ˜„');
}
```
You can use Talker instance everywhere in your code<br>
Simple and concise syntax will help you with this
```dart
final talker = Talker();
// Handle exceptions and errors
try {
  // your code...
} on Exception catch (e, st) {
  talker.handle(e, st, 'Exception in ...');
}

// Make logs
talker.log('App is started'),
talker.error('App is started'),
talker.waring('App is started'),
```
More examples you can get [there](../guide/examples) or in [GitHub](https://github.com/Frezyx/talker/blob/master/packages/talker/example/talker_example.dart) 

## Flutter initialization
Setup Talker to listen your app uncaught exceptions in [runZonedGuarded](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) **onError()** callback
```dart
void main() {
  final talker = Talker();
  runZonedGuarded(
    () => runApp(BaseEample(talker: talker)),
    (Object error, StackTrace stack) {
      talker.handle(error, stack, 'Uncaught app exception');
    },
  );
}
```
After such initialization, all uncaught errors and exceptions will be sent to Talker for processing
