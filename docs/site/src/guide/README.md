Talker is **advanced exception handler and logger for dart and Flutter applications**.<br>
It was created for the simplest integration of the logger and error handler functionality into your application. The main idea of the project is **set up once and reuse several times**.

One of the important points of the package is **self understanding** which of your logs and errors need to be reported to the client, which need to be sent to analytics, and which can be skipped. **Without many if-else conditions and top-level logic**.

This package can be implemented both at the beginning of work with the project, and for systems with many years of contribution.
